# LINEAR-DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS-AND-LOGISTIC-REGRESSION-USING-R
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and logistic regression (LR) generally utilize multivariate measurable strategies for investigation of information with straight out result factors. The two of them are appropriate for the development of linear classification models. However, the both the methods vary in their fundamental thought. While Logistics regression makes no assumptions on the distribution of the explanatory data, Linear Discriminant Analysis has been framed for normally distributed explanatory variables. It is therefore assumed that Linear Discriminant Analysis to give better outcomes in the case when the normality conditions are to be fulfilled, but in other cases Logistics Regression should be more reasonable.
